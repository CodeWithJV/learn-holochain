# Installation

Before starting the curriculum modules, you need to set up your development environment for Holochain.

## Getting Holochain Installed

Your first mission is to install Holochain and run the "Hello World" application. This will ensure you have all the necessary components to work through the curriculum.

Please follow the official installation guide:

[Holochain Getting Started Guide](https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/)

The guide will walk you through:

1. Installing the Holochain development environment
2. Setting up the necessary tools and dependencies
3. Installing and running your first Holochain application

## Verifying Your Installation

After following the installation guide, you should be able to successfully run the hello world application. You're welcome to go through the full guide if you wish, but we will be covering that material (and a lot more) in this course.

If you encounter any issues during installation, check the [Troubleshooting](https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/#troubleshooting) section of the guide or ask for help in the [Holochain Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/k55DS5dmPH).

## Development Environment

For this curriculum, you'll need:

- **Nix package manager**: Used to provide a consistent development environment
- **Text editor or IDE**: VS Code with Rust  and JavaScript extensions is recommended

Optionally it is useful to have the following, they you can get by without them and just use them in the nix environment.

- **Rust and Cargo**: For developing Holochain zomes
- **Node.js and npm**: For UI development and testing

Once you have successfully installed Holochain and run the "Hello World" application, you're ready to start Module 1!
