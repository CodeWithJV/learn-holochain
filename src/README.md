# Learn Holochain

Welcome to Learn Holochain! This guide is an implementation of the Open Holochain Curriculum, a self-directed, self-paced, free online course designed to help you learn Holochain development.

## What is Holochain?

Holochain is a framework for building distributed applications that doesn't rely on centralized servers or global consensus blockchains. Instead, it uses an agent-centric approach where each participant maintains their own chain of cryptographically signed records, while a distributed hash table (DHT) enables data sharing and validation across the network.

## Prerequisites

This curriculum assumes you have:
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript
- Some experience with Rust programming
- Comfort with command-line tools
- Understanding of basic programming concepts

If you need to brush up on Rust, these resources can help:
- Chapters 1â€“11 in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
- [Rust on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)

## Learning Path

This curriculum is organized around four progressive modules, each building on the skills and concepts from the previous one:

1. **Module 1: Actions and Entries**: Learn the fundamentals of Holochain's data model by building a joke app with CRUD operations
2. **Module 2: Links and Collections**: Explore relationships between data by creating a blog with posts and comments
3. **Module 3: Testing and Validation**: Implement data validation rules and tests to ensure integrity
4. **Module 4: Scaffolding and Signals**: Learn rapid app development with scaffolding tools and real-time communication

## How to Use This Guide

We recommend working through the modules in order. Start with Module 1 to grasp the fundamentals, then progress through each subsequent module to build your Holochain development skills.

Before diving into the modules, make sure to complete the [Installation](installation.md) steps to set up your development environment.
