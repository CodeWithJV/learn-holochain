# Links and Collections

Module 2 builds on your knowledge of Entries and Actions by introducing Links and Collections - essential mechanisms for creating relationships between data in Holochain.

## What You'll Learn

- **Links**: How to create connections between entries in the DHT
- **Link Structure**: Understanding base, target, tag, and link types
- **Collections**: Creating grouped sets of data using Paths
- **Relationships**: Building complex data relationships in a distributed environment
- **Querying**: Techniques for retrieving linked data efficiently

## The Blog App

In this module, you'll build a blog application that demonstrates how to create and manage relationships between different types of data. You'll implement:

- Creating blog posts with authors
- Linking comments to posts
- Creating collections of posts using Paths
- Retrieving related content through links
- Managing updates to linked content

Links are a fundamental concept in Holochain that enable you to build sophisticated data structures in a distributed environment. Unlike traditional databases with tables and foreign keys, Holochain uses links to establish connections between entries in the DHT.

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to design and implement relationships between data in your Holochain applications, enabling more complex and feature-rich applications.
