# Scaffolding and Signals

Module 4 introduces powerful tools for accelerating development and enabling real-time communication in Holochain applications.

## What You'll Learn

- **Scaffolding**: Using Holochain's scaffolding tools to generate common code patterns
- **Code Generation**: Automating the creation of CRUD operations and validation rules
- **Signals**: Implementing real-time communication between agents in a Holochain network
- **Remote Calls**: Sending notifications and updates to other users
- **Real-time Applications**: Building interactive applications with immediate updates

## The Messaging App

In this module, you'll build a messaging application that demonstrates real-time communication between users:

- Creating direct messages between users
- Implementing real-time notifications using signals
- Building conversation threads with multiple participants
- Using scaffolding to rapidly develop the application structure
- Managing user presence and typing indicators

Scaffolding tools accelerate development by automating repetitive code patterns, allowing you to focus on unique aspects of your application. Signals enable real-time interactivity, creating a more responsive user experience.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to rapidly develop sophisticated Holochain applications with interactive features, bringing your applications closer to the responsiveness users expect from modern web applications.
